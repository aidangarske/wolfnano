# Constant-time discipline: the wolfNanoTLS shell (src/) must compare MACs / secrets
# with ConstantCompare, never the variable-time memcmp / XMEMCMP. This guards the
# handshake's secret comparisons (server Finished, PSK binder) against timing
# side channels. tests/ and bench/ may use XMEMCMP for non-secret vector checks,
# so only src/ + include/ are scanned. Excludes the wolfssl submodule.

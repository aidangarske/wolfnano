/* Generic no-OS / baremetal MCU build (portable C, no asm bundle): minimal PSK
 * + X25519 floor. The integration must provide entropy via wn_seed() and the
 * transport via the wn_IoSend / wn_IoRecv callbacks. Pick an asm bundle with a
 * WOLFNANO_TARGET_* device profile when one fits. Copy as user_settings.h. */
